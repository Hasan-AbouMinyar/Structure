## üìö Lecture 7: Object-oriented Design using UML (ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿßÿ∂ÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿ®ÿπÿ©)

### **Main Topics:**
- **Class Diagrams** - Static structure diagrams representing system architecture
- **Object Diagrams** - Instance-level representations
- **State Machine Diagrams** - Behavioral modeling
- **Activity Diagrams** - Process flow modeling

### **Key Concepts Covered:**

#### üèóÔ∏è **UML Class Diagrams**
- Definition: Static structure diagrams in UML representing system structure and behavior
- Components: Classes depicted as boxes with connecting lines showing relationships
- Purpose: Describes classes of applications and their relationships

#### üìã **Class Fundamentals**
- **Class Structure**: Three-compartment boxes containing:
  - Name
  - Attributes (Properties/Variables)
  - Methods (Actions/Behaviors)
- **From Diagram to Code**: Class diagrams serve as blueprints for implementation

#### üîí **Visibility Modifiers**
Four types of visibility in object-oriented programming:
- **Public (+)**: Accessible from anywhere
- **Private (-)**: Accessible only within the class
- **Protected (#)**: Accessible within class and subclasses
- **Package (~)**: Accessible within the same package

#### üîó **Relationships Between Classes**
1. **Associations** - Basic relationships between classes
2. **Aggregation** - "Has-a" relationships (weak ownership)
3. **Composition** - Strong ownership relationships
4. **Inheritance** - "Is-a" relationships (generalization)

#### üî¢ **Multiplicity**
- **One-to-One (1:1)**
- **One-to-Many (1:N)**
- **Many-to-One (N:1)**
- **Many-to-Many (N:N)**

### **Learning Objectives:**
Students will understand how to:
- Create and interpret UML class diagrams
- Model object-oriented systems using UML
- Understand class relationships and interactions
- Apply visibility principles in design
- Convert UML diagrams to code implementation
